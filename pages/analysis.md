# Analysis
---

The data I collected was very easily made much clear with the use of charts and graphs and really started to give a picture of trends.  I have found that 1,493 individuals have been executed in the past 42 years.  I can also tell from what data I have collected that most executions since 1977 have been males, with over 88% of these people have gone by lethal injection. Also, I noticed that the greatest number of them have been executed in between 30 to 50 years of age.  

# Age

To graphing the age the best approach I found was a scatter plot, originally starting with a line graph, that did not show the exact pin point of the ages and got a little to confusing to read so a scatter plot worked perfect for what was needed.  It starts off with relatively small numbers toward the lower ages, but you can see it gets to its highest number of record in the late 30s peaking the chart before it starts to lower back down as age goes up.  

# Sex

Sex of each was best shown as a bar graph, not surprised to see it as mostly males as thatâ€™s all I ever see on the news but much smaller number of females than I would have thought beforehand.  

# Race & Methods

For method and race graph a bar graph worked best for both, it explains the points on their information quickest and easiest, different dimensions and valued measures.  I was shocked to see that a firing squad is still being used since 1977 and the strangest was the most recent use was only 2010, more recent than the last hanging.  

# 1977-Present

I created this group of maps to show where each state stood as of 1977 when they reannounced the death penalty was indeed constitutional; a few states have changed their stance through the years, but many have stayed on the same side on which they started. 

# Americas numbers

I wanted to see where most of these executions are taking place in, I would have believed Texas lead the nation, but I would have never guessed by that many.  Not one state comes close to the number of executions preformed in Texas.  

# Florida

While doing this project I was curious about how the place we lived stood up compared to the rest of the country.  I found a few interesting points out about it one being we are 4th in nation for the amount of executions we have done and 3rd in terms of number of females.  This is something I would not have guessed in Florida.
