We can follow executions back for thousand of years, I want to see when public support changed for them.  Why were public executions moved inside, is there a trend on what methods are used to carry out executions of a certain time period.  Any specific race or region of the U.S. stand out more than the others?  With my research online and data I was able to pull I plan on looking into all this and more.

## Historical Background

Executions can be traced back as far back at the 18th century BC to the Ancient Laws of China.  “In the 18th Century BC, the Code of King Hammurabi of Babylon codified the death penalty for twenty five different crimes, although murder was not one of them” (Reggio).  We don’t have our first record of death until 16th Century BC in Egypt where a man was accused of using magic and sentence to take his own life.  From there the times change back and forth on reasoning you’d be order to death or the methods used to carry it out.  At one point in the 7th Century BC every crime committed got you the death penalty.  Methods have a wide range from being submersed in water within a sack, drinking a poison, burning alive, stoning, beheading, crucifixion (History.com) the list could go on for a while, they’ve even thrown the criminals from high up rocks or condemned them into a quagmire, a similar type of land to quicksand.  Heading into the 10th Century AD we see that “hanging from gallows was the most frequent execution method” (Reggio).  

Fast forward to the 16th Century the average person still had no say in how their government was and they could not do anything about the government executing people.  It is estimated that numbers as high as 72,000 people were put to death under the reign of King Henry VIII.  Capital offenses in which you could be put to death keep going up until it reached 222 crimes in the 18th century, the range of offenses could be as simple as cutting down a tree or counterfeiting tax stamps.   Soon things start to change in the other direction, since the 19th Century capital offenses have slowly begun to be pushed out and swept away, and even more so during the 20th century.  Many country’s have gotten rid of the death penalty as a whole, even in the United States it’s a state by state decision and nearly half the states chose to not have a death penalty or to not use it.  

In 1972 the United States Supreme Court ruled on a 5-4 vote that the death penalty was unconstitutional.  They said that it violated the United States 8th Amendment for “Cruel and unusual punishment.”  They stated that new laws and way of carrying it out could remake it constitutional again.  Four years later in 1976 after new legislation was passed on the death penalty the United States Supreme Court ruled it was once again constitution to use the death penalty as a capital punishment.  In 2005 the Supreme Court stepped in again and stated that the death penalty for juveniles was not allowed to be an option, after 22 defendants had already been put to death for crimes as a juvenile since 1977.  

Looking at polls and approval ratings for the death penalty already in only the past 20 years we can see a steady decline in support.  A poll in 2000 by ABC News said that support had dropped 13% in the past four years since 1996 down from the 77% of support in ‘96.  As of mid-2018 another poll came out by Pew with numbers of support as low as 54% supporting the death penalty and 39% opposed to it.  It’s obvious that the death penalty is not what it once was with people coming out in large crowds to watch something, they all supported to now it’s nearing a 50/50 split, as support falls the opposition steadily gains.
