Executions at one point were a popular event held infront of large crowds that jeered and applaud.  There were different forms of execution used depending on the level of crime carried out, at a time some of these executions were public torture to deter others from committing the same crimes.  Throughout the years that had slowly changed now we typically try to be more humane with the act and now no public executions are held only ones with a small group of loved ones or victims to watch the act get carried out.  

My project is set up to focus on and analyze data through visualizes retaining to United States executions since 1977.  I am working from 1977 onward because for a short time the death penalty was suspended and called unconstitutional by the United States Supreme Court. That changed however in 1976 with a new death penalty statute, reinstating it as constitutional. 

This is a very controversial subject among citizens today as it has been for years and I want to look to see if I can find any patterns or trends in location, race, age and more. While doing so I will be comparing Florida with the rest of the nation on our own executions.  I will be doing this all by using Webscraper for my data gathering and Tableau for all my visualizations.
